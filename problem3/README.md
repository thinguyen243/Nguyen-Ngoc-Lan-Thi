## Computational inefficiencies and anti-patterns in the provided code:

### 1. Typo in variables:
Incorrect variable name "lhsPriority" should be corrected to "balancePriority".

### 2. Inefficient sorting logic:
The sorting logic in the "sortedBalances" useMemo could be optimized and made more concise. The "if (lhsPriority > -99)" should use "balancePriority" instead of "lhsPriority".

### 3. Improper condition check:
Incorrect condition check in the filter function. It should be "if (balancePriority > -99)" instead of "if (lhsPriority > -99)".

### 4. Inconsistent variable names:
In the sorting function, there's inconsistency in variable names like "lhs" and "left". It's better to use consistent variable names for clarity.

### 5. Unused Variable:
The "formattedBalances" variable is calculated but not used further in the code. It's better to remove such unused variables to improve code cleanliness.

### 6. Missing Dependency in useMemo:
The "getPriority" function is used inside the "useMemo" callback but not added to the dependency array. It should be included to ensure proper re-evaluation when "getPriority" changes.


### Note:
In the refactored version ("wallet.tsx" file), I addressed the mentioned inefficiencies and anti-patterns. The code is now more optimized, clearer, and less error-prone.
